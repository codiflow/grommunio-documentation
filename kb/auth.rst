Authentication
==============

As of Gromox 1.33, only HTTP Basic authentication is offered. We have a patch
that makes Gromox send the WWW-Authentication header with the ``charset``
parameter (RFC 7617 ยง2.1), however, the MSRPC libraries ignore this. We
recognize there are two bugs with Windows:

  * When entering a password with an umlaut, the copy of Windows we used
    transmits in local codepage, but nowhere does it indicate the codepage in
    the HTTP request. This is a serious design deficiency, especially
    considering the MAPI protocols themselves *do* have a means to convey the
    corresponding codepage number when transmitting 8-bit MAPI property string
    values! The HTTP requests are also sent with ample custom headers in
    general.)

  * When entering a password with a CJK character, the copy of Windows we used
    does not transmit *any* `Authorization` header *at all*.

The Internet Options control panel dialog `[1] <_static/img/auth_intopts.png>`_
`[2] <_static/img/auth_intopts2.png>`_ which concerns itself with system HTTP libraries
of the old days does not influence this.
