Update Cycle
============

RH vs SUSE
----------

> *We do not want to update all that often, so we are choosing RHEL/CentOS/Alma/etc.*

CentOS (classic) had two service pack releases per year, as does AlmaLinux
currently, e.g. AlmaLinux 9.0 released on 2022-05-26, and 9.1 on 2022-11-17,
whereby 9.0 is already out of support again. This means that every SP in
the 8.x/9.x series lives only 6 to 8 months.

With SUSE Linux Enterprise/Leap, the service packs are published once per year,
e.g. SLE 15.3 released on 2021-06-21, 15.4 on 2022-06-08, and 15.5 to be made
on or about 2023-06-01, and the projected support period for each SP is *18* months.

In other words, the update cadence is in favor of a SUSE-based distribution.
The default lifetime of the entire 15.x series is speced for about 10 years by
SUSE (2018..2028), which is the same as for RHEL and its derivatives (also 10
years).
