Update Cycle
============

RH vs SUSE
----------

> *We do not want to update all that often, so we are choosing
> RHEL/CentOS/Alma/etc.*

CentOS (while it existed) had two releases per year, as does AlmaLinux
currently, e.g. AlmaLinux 9.0 released on 2022-05-26, and 9.1 on 2022-11-17,
whereby 9.0 is already out of support again. This means that every release in
the 8.x/9.x series lives but 6 to 8 months.

With SUSE Linux Enterprise/Leap, the point releases are made once per year,
e.g. SLE 15.3 released on 2021-06-21, 15.4 on 2022-06-08, and 15.5 to be made
on or about 2023-06-01, and the projected lifetime of each is *18* months.

In other words, the update cadence is in favor of a SUSE-based distribution.
The default lifetime of the entire 15.x series is speced for about 10 years by
SUSE (2018..2028), which is the same as for RHEL and its derivatives (also 10
years).
